Tic-tac-toe - 15x15 board

Classic tic tac toe game with czech mode - 15x15 array.

Main difference between this version and first one is board dimension and new required algorithms for solving. Classic "3x3 - match 3" version was easy solved by checking each row, column or diagonal. This version "15x15 - match 5" requires new solution as checking 5 same symbols in different positions in row/column/diagonals and its children.
